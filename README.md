CA Proposition 21 research. The core issue is not simply running a statistical regression on variables of city income and homelessness. Rather our subject matter expert encouraged us to go into the crux of the issue, that is, whether or not the arguments for each side are supported by the data. Because the primary argument for opposing prop 21 is that increasing rent control will decrease housing availablity (as others believe is a driver of the homelessness problem in CA) our research question is as follows: Does stricter rent control truly does disincentivize land developers from building new housing?


Motivation: Concerns of homelessness and housing insecurity among students in UC Davis, as well as personal interest in real estate and housing in California
